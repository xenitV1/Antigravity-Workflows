description: Analyze code blocks for SonarQube errors and refactor them to meet Quality Gates
---

1. Ask the user for the code block that needs analysis.
2. Ask the user for the specific SonarQube error message or Rule ID (e.g., "Cognitive Complexity is too high").
3. Analyze the provided code block to identify the problematic logic.
4. Explain the root cause of the SonarQube warning in Turkish to the user.
5. Refactor the code to satisfy the SonarQube Quality Gate while strictly preserving the original logic.
6. Present the refactored code clearly to the user.
