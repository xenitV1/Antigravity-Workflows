# Changelog

## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- **Commands Directory Location:** Moved command files directly to `global_workflows/` folder to ensure slash commands appear with `/` prefix in Antigravity IDE.
- **Installation Scripts:** Updated installation instructions for Windows (PowerShell) and macOS/Linux (Bash) in `README.md` to reflect the new `global_workflows` directory structure.
- **Documentation:** Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `README.md` to reflect the new directory layout.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-14

### Removed
- **Global Scripts Directory:** Deleted the top-level `scripts/` directory. Automation scripts are now located specifically within their relevant skill folders (e.g., `skills/<skill>/scripts/`).
- **CODEBASE.md:** Removed from version control as it is auto-generated by session hooks.

### Changed
- **Documentation Alignment:** Updated `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `GEMINI.md` to reflect the removal of the top-level `scripts` directory while maintaining references to skill-based runtime scripts.
- **Configuration:** Adjusted `.gitignore` and system configuration to align with the new skill-centric script structure.


## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Maestro Integration:** Integrated the Maestro agent and skill structure (based on Maestro v4.1 standards).
- **Dynamic directory support:** Agents now reside in `~/.agent/agents/` and core system in `~/.gemini/antigravity/` for better user-specific context.
- **New Agents:** Added `database-architect`, `devops-engineer`, `documentation-writer`, `explorer-agent`, `game-developer`, `penetration-tester`, `performance-optimizer`, `seo-specialist`, `test-engineer`.
- **New Skills:** Expanded skill library to 35 categories including `clean-code`, `brainstorming`, `security-auditor`, etc.

### Changed
- **Major Restructuring:**
  - Migrated from legacy structure to dynamic user-home based paths.
  - Renamed `CLAUDE.md` to `GEMINI.md` as the central configuration file.
