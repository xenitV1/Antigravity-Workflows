#  Agent Workflows

> This directory contains step-by-step procedures (recipes) for complex and repetitive tasks.

##  Overview

**Workflows** serve as the "playbook" for the Agent. They answer the question: **"What steps should I follow?"**
These are applied at the **Trajectory** level, guiding the execution flow from start to finish.

###  Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Procedures** | Pre-defined steps for common tasks (Deploy, Test, Refactor). |
| **Slash Commands** | Triggered via /command (e.g., /deploy). |
| **Consistency** | Ensures every task is executed with the same high quality. |

##  Available Workflows

| Workflow | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| debug.md | /debug | Systematic debugging & analysis |
| deploy.md | /deploy | Production deployment workflow |
| docs.md | /docs | Documentation generation |
| geo.md | /geo | GEO (AI engine) optimization |
| implement.md | /implement | Feature implementation guide |
| plan.md | /plan | Architecture & planning session |
| refactor.md | /refactor | Code refactoring workflow |
| review.md | /review | Code review & quality check |
| seo.md | /seo | SEO (Google/Bing) optimization |
| test.md | /test | Comprehensive testing execution |
| ultrathink.md | /ultrathink | Deep thinking & problem solving |

##  Usage

To use a workflow:
1.  **Type** the slash command in the chat (e.g., /plan).
2.  **Follow** the agent's prompts as it executes the steps.
3.  **Customize** these files to adapt the process to your team's needs.
