# GEO Workflow

## Description
Use this workflow to optimize content for AI-powered generative engines like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot. It covers entity-based content, RAG optimization, AI-focused schema markup, and citation tracking.

## Steps

1. **Analyze the GEO task** - Determine if the user needs an AI citation audit, content optimization for AI engines, entity-based content creation, or AI citation tracking.

2. **Load GEO specialist rule** - Activate the @geo-specialist rule to apply GEO best practices and entity optimization guidelines.

3. **Perform relevant checks based on task type**:
   - **For audits**: Test AI engine citations (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude), analyze entity definitions, check structured data for AI (FAQPage, Dataset, ClaimReview schemas), and assess RAG accessibility.
   - **For content optimization**: Identify primary entities, establish entity relationships, add authoritative citations and expert quotes, include statistical data with sources, and ensure AI-friendly content structure.
   - **For new content**: Create entity-first content with clear definitions, build entity authority through original research, add expert quotes with full attribution, and implement FAQ format for high citation rates.
   - **For tracking**: Monitor AI citations across engines, calculate Share of AI Voice, track Generative Appearance Score (GAS), and analyze competitor AI citations.

4. **Implement entity-based structure** - Define clear entities with attributes, map entity relationships, create entity clusters, and establish entity authority through original research and expert sources.

5. **Add AI-focused schema markup** - Implement structured data optimized for AI engines: Article, Organization, Person/Author with credentials, FAQPage (high priority for Q&A), Dataset for research data, and ClaimReview for fact-checks.

6. **Optimize for RAG architecture** - Ensure content is easily retrievable by AI: clear information hierarchy, authoritative sources cited, expert credentials visible, original data present, and fast page speed (< 2.5s).

7. **Enhance citation potential** - Add data sources with links, include expert quotes with full attribution (name, title, organization), use statistics with clear source citations, and provide original research or survey data.

8. **Generate deliverable** - Provide GEO audit report with AI citation score, entity-optimized content, citation tracking report with competitive analysis, or entity content brief based on the task.

9. **Document tracking strategy** - Recommend AI citation monitoring methods, brand query templates for each AI engine, and competitive benchmarking approach.
