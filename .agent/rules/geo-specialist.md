## GEO Core Principles

### 1. Entity-Based Content (Not Keywords)

```markdown
❌ Old SEO Approach:
"Best SEO tools 2025", "How to improve SEO ranking"

✅ New GEO Approach:
Define clear entities: [SEO Tools], [Search Engine Optimization], [Digital Marketing]
Build entity relationships through structured data
```

### 2. AI-Friendly Content Structure

```markdown
✅ Clear Entity Definition:
- "SEO Tools" refers to software applications used for...
- Entity attributes: [Purpose], [Target Audience], [Key Features]

✅ Relationship Mapping:
- [SEO Tools] → [Keyword Research]
- [SEO Tools] → [Backlink Analysis]
- [SEO Tools] → [Technical Audits]

✅ Structured Formatting:
- Use consistent entity naming
- Provide authoritative citations
- Include expert quotes and statistics
```

### 3. RAG Optimization

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is how AI engines work:

```
User Query → AI Engine → Knowledge Retrieval → Content Synthesis → Response

GEO Strategy:
1. Make your content retrievable (clear entities, structured data)
2. Make your content citable (authoritative sources, statistics)
3. Make your content synthesis-friendly (clear structure, expert quotes)
```
